      <google-codelab-step label="Food places if you&#39;re hungry" duration="2">
        <p>Food is one of the things that matter to us the most! Within the school, there are a few eateries that students go to if they fancy something outside the canteen.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GomGom</strong> (Sub/Sandwich cafe)<br>Opening Hours: 9am to 8pm (weekdays) 12pm to 6pm (Sunday)</li>
<li><strong>Crooked Cooks </strong>(Western and Japanese restaurant with a bar)<br>Opening Hours: 9am to 11pm (weekdays) 10am to 10pm (Saturday)</li>
<li><strong>D&#39;Cafe</strong> (Asian-Western fusion)<br>Opening Hours: 9am to 8pm (weekdays)</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of restaurants at <strong>Changi City Point</strong> (CCP) offers food at prices that are friendlier for students. CCP is within walking distance, one MRT stop away (Expo MRT). There is also a shuttle bus that runs at 30 minute intervals (starting at 11:15am and ending at 7:45pm).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soup Spoon Union<br></strong>Offers student meals at $6.90<br>Student meal hours: Mondays to Fridays, until 6:30pm</li>
<li><strong>Wolf Burgers<br></strong>Burgers and a meal at 10% student discount</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jewel@Changi Airport </strong>(closest thing to paradise itself)</p>
<p>Blogs such as <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/jewel-changi" target="_blank">TheSmartLocal</a>, <a href="https://www.timeout.com/singapore/things-to-do/the-ultimate-guide-to-jewel-changi-airport" target="_blank">TimeOut</a>, and <a href="https://danielfooddiary.com/2019/04/13/jewelchangi/" target="_blank">DanielFoodDiary</a> have written so much about Jewel. Guess what? We&#39;re literally two MRT stops away! If we were to list the number of restaurants it would take up the rest of the page... so we&#39;ll leave you to explore it yourself!</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Getting Around" duration="0">
        <p>After some time in school, you would realise that rooms in our school are often referred to using code numbers (e.g. 2.506). Here&#39;s a quick breakdown of what this code means to ease getting yourself around:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>#</strong>.### The number at the left of the decimal represents the building where the room may be found.</li>
<li>Building 1 is where the library may be found</li>
<li>Building 2 is where the campus center may be found</li>
<li>Building 3 is opposite the campus center, where GongCha may be found</li>
<li>Building 5 is where the FabLab may be found</li>
<li>#.<strong>#### </strong>For the number at the right of the decimal, the first digit represents the floor where the building may be found, and the other two numbers represent the room number.</li>
</ul>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Collaboration Spaces" duration="0">
        <p>Spaces to work after class are not limited to your cohort classrooms. Here is a quick list of alternatives that are used by your seniors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostel meeting room/study room</li>
<li>Hostel rooftop</li>
<li>Library</li>
<li>Pi Lab (located beside the printing room at building 1 level 5)</li>
<li>Student Activity Center (located at building 5 level 4)</li>
<li>Root Cove (located at building 2 level 3 and 4)</li>
</ul>
