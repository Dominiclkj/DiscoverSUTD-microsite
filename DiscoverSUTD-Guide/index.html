        <h2 is-upgraded><strong>Food places if you&#39;re hungry</strong></h2>

<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Getting Around</strong></h2>
<p>After some time in school, you would realise that rooms in our school are often referred to using code numbers (e.g. 2.506). Here&#39;s a quick breakdown of what this code means to ease getting yourself around:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number at the left of the decimal represents the building where the room may be found.</li>
<li>Building 1 is where the campus center may be found</li>
<li>Building 2 is where the library may be found</li>
<li>Building 3 is opposite the campus center, where GongCha may be found</li>
<li>Building 5 is where the FabLab may be found</li>
<li>For the number at the right of the decimal, the first digit represents the floor where the building may be found, and the other two numbers represent the room number.</li>
</ul>
