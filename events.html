						Session 1: <br><br>

						We will teach participants the basics of standard ballroom dance (waltz), which they can apply
						in social dance settings. A taste of standard ballroom dance that is different from our usual
						competition practice sessions.<br><br>

						Participants will learn some basic moves in standard ballroom, and will learn a routine that
						they can show off at social gatherings (progressive waltz - ie waltz that involves the constant
						change of partner)<br><br>

						Participants will also get to experience a different form of dance which is not commonly
						available<br><br>

						Session 2: <br><br>

						Introduction the freshies to another form of pair dance, one that is apart from the competition
						dances that we do in standard ballroom.

						No pre-requisites, but we do encourage them to bring a friend along as your dance partner :)
						(there will be seniors around to partner the participants, so no worries if they come alone)

						<h4>Organised by ROOT Communications team</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						<b>Free Gongcha up for grabs!</b><br><br>

						The first GRASS Session for Freshmores! GRASS is ROOT's engagement platform for us to be
						transparent about university and ROOT matters, involve you in our projects and to hear about
						concerns that you might have.<br><br>

						Tell us your feedback about Orientation and ask us anything you would like to know about SUTD!
						We will also be sharing with you some SUTD hacks that could be useful to you in your journey in
						SUTD.<br><br>

						The main objective is to introduce Freshmores to GRASS as a platform for us to engage them and
						for them to share their concerns and get involved with us on projects that matter to them.
						<br><br>

						During this GRASS, we will be gathering feedback that they may have about Orientation through
						focus group discussions with the orientation organizing committee. <br><br>

						To help the freshmores with the start of their journey, we will also have ROOT members there to
						answer any queries they might have and we will be preparing an SUTD hacks sheet for them to take
						with them when they come for the session.<br><br>

						The session will be held at ROOT Cove to also introduce the freshmores to the venue as a student
						recreation space and the max capacity will be approximately 40 students at a time. As the
						session is free and easy, students will be allowed to walk in and out freely and no sign ups are
						required.<br><br>

						ROOT members will be there to help facilitate the session.
